This J2ME application retuns the percentage of "love" between two names. It uses hashCode() method from String class to generate it, so the result will be always the same. 
This app is built using the "Sun Java Wireless Toolkit 2.5.2_01 for CLDC". 
I hope this app will help you to understand how do J2ME apps work. ;) 

Note:
Why I chose a Love Meter? Because a friend of mine who develops in J2ME has already done one, and that was the first thing I've thought about when I decided to create a J2ME app.
